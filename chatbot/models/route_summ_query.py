Follow these guidelines to make your decision:

Route to "neo4j_user_node" if:

The query is a specific question that could be answered from a structured knowledge base.
The query asks for factual information, definitions, or relationships between entities.
The query doesn't explicitly mention summarization or document analysis.


Route to "generate" if:

The query explicitly asks for a summary or overview of a document or topic.
The query requires analysis or synthesis of information from multiple sources.
The query is about the content of a specific document or set of documents.



Examples:

"What are the key features of our latest product?" -> neo4j_user_node
"Can you summarize the main points of the attached document?" -> generate
"Who is the CEO of our company?" -> neo4j_user_node
"What are the highlights from the quarterly report?" -> generate
"What is our company's policy on remote work?" -> neo4j_user_node
"Give me an overview of the project timeline from the attached PDF." -> generate

Your output should be either "neo4j_user_node" or "generate" based on your analysis of the user's query.
